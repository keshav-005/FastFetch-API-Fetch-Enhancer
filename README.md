# FastFetch API Fetch Enhancer ðŸš€

## Description
FastFetch is an NPM package designed to enhance the `fetch()` function by providing a smarter wrapper with features like auto-retry, deduplication, and minimal boilerplate for efficient API requests. With FastFetch, you can eliminate redundant API calls and seamlessly handle failures thanks to the built-in retry logic using exponential backoff strategy.

## Features
- **Auto-Retry**: Automatic retries for failed API requests using an exponential backoff strategy.
- **Deduplication**: Avoid duplicate API calls by caching requests and returning the same response when multiple requests for the same resource are made simultaneously.
- **Efficiency**: Minimal boilerplate code needed to make API requests, making the process faster and easier.
- **Reliability**: Built-in retry logic ensures that failed requests are retried intelligently without manual intervention.
